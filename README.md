# IaC-Assessment-using-Pulumi

Sure, here's a detailed explanation of the Pulumi code:

1. **Create a new VPC**: This creates a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. A VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.

```python
vpc = ec2.Vpc('my-vpc')
```

2. **Create a new ECS cluster**: This creates a new Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster. An ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services.

```python
cluster = ecs.Cluster('my-cluster')
```

3. **Create a new IAM role for the ECS tasks**: This creates a new Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that the ECS tasks can assume. The role has a policy attached that allows it to perform actions on behalf of the ECS tasks.

```python
task_execution_role = iam.Role('ecsTaskExecutionRole', ...)
iam.RolePolicyAttachment('ecsTaskExecutionRolePolicy', ...)
```

4. **Create a new ECS task definition**: This creates a new ECS task definition. A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. It specifies various parameters such as the Docker image to use, the required CPU and memory, the network mode, and the container definitions.

```python
task_definition = ecs.TaskDefinition('my-task', ...)
```

5. **Create a new security group for the API**: This creates a new security group for the API. A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.

```python
api_sg = ec2.SecurityGroup('api-sg', ...)
```

6. **Create a new ECS service**: This creates a new ECS service. An ECS service enables you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an ECS cluster.

```python
service = ecs.Service('my-service', ...)
```

7. **Create a new ALB**: This creates a new Application Load Balancer (ALB). An ALB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.

```python
alb = alb.LoadBalancer('my-alb', ...)
```

8. **Create a new target group**: This creates a new target group. A target group tells the load balancer where to direct traffic.

```python
target_group = alb.TargetGroup('my-target-group', ...)
```

9. **Register the ECS service with the target group**: This registers the ECS service with the target group. This means that the load balancer will distribute traffic to the tasks managed by the ECS service.

```python
listener = alb.Listener('my-listener', ...)
```

10. **Create a new security group for the Web UI**: This creates a new security group for the Web UI.

```python
webui_sg = ec2.SecurityGroup('webui-sg', ...)
```

11. **Create a new ECS service for the Web UI**: This creates a new ECS service for the Web UI.

```python
webui_service = ecs.Service('webui-service', ...)
```

12. **Export the URL of the ALB**: This exports the DNS name of the ALB as an output of the Pulumi stack. This allows you to easily retrieve the URL of the ALB after the stack has been deployed.

```python
pulumi.export('url', alb.dns_name)
```

This Pulumi code deploys a web application and API on AWS using ECS and ALB. The API is only accessible within the VPC, and the Web UI is only accessible over the internet.
